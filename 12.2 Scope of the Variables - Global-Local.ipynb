    "**What is Namespace?**\n",
    "\n",
    "A namespace is a system in which each object in Python has a separate name. An object could be a method or a variable. In other words, a namespace is a mapping from names to objects. Most namespaces are currently implemented as Python dictionaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is Scope?**\n",
    "\n",
    "A scope is a concept describes where or in which space the variables are defined in the program stream. This concept has a significant place in programming. In other words, a scope is a textual region of a Python program where a namespace is directly accessible. \n",
    "The term scope is mostly related to nested functions, modules, and the main program flow in accordance with the use of variables. It describes the accessibility and the existence of a variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "A scope defines the hierarchical order in which the names of the variables have to exist in order to match names with the objects (variables)."
